scala-matrix
========

Playing with function composition.  This project attempts to define a Matrix class that can contain functions.  You can add and multiply matricies of functions and resolve them with arguments.

This would be useful for implementing any number of calculations where it is clearer/easier to understand if you keep things in function form until the last possible instant.
